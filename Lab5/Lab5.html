            <p>I started the web site because Halloween has always been my favorite holiday. But during the 
                last year, I started selling some of my favorite Halloween products, and they've become quite a hit.
            </p>
            <p> If you click on the Personal link, you can browse my favorite Halloween pictures, stories, and films. And if you join my email list, I will keep you up-to-date on all things Halloween.
